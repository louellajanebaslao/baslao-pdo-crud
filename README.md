The commit "Added Template/Pages" introduces several updates to the project, mainly adding new pages and templates to the application. It introduces new components like `About.tsx`, `Details.tsx`, `Home.tsx`, `Login.tsx`, `Menu.tsx`, and `Template.tsx`, which are structured using Ionicâ€™s UI components such as `IonButton`, `IonContent`, `IonMenuButton`, and `IonPage`. These pages are integrated into the app's routing system to allow seamless navigation between sections. The `Menu.tsx` file implements a sidebar-style menu linking to various sections, while the `Home.tsx` file adds a tabbed navigation system with tabs like `Feed`, `Search`, and `Favorites`, each displaying simple placeholder content. Additionally, basic styling has been applied to maintain consistent layout and alignment across the views. Routing in `App.tsx` has been updated to handle these new pages and facilitate smooth navigation. Overall, these changes enhance the structure of the app by providing a clean, functional user interface and streamlined navigation.
